Arrays 1D - Count distinct elements
Harish and Rajesh were developing a plan to find the ideal woman for Sheldon Cooper. There were puzzles, translations, and questions to check a person's intelligence. One such question was to come up with a program to count the number of distinct elements in an array. Harini is a postdoctoral researcher and a former graduate student of Caltech who is a huge fan of Sheldon's work and she wanted to impress Sheldon by writing a program to count the number of distinct element in an array. Can you help Harini?

import java.io.*;
import java.util.*;

public class Solution {

    public static void main(String[] args) {
        /* Enter your code here. Read input from STDIN. Print output to STDOUT. Your class should be named Solution. */
        Scanner sc=new Scanner(System.in);
        int n=sc.nextInt();
        HashSet<Integer> h=new HashSet<>();
        for(int i=0;i<n;i++){
            h.add(sc.nextInt());
        }
        System.out.print("There are " + h.size()+" distinct element in the array.");
    }
}
